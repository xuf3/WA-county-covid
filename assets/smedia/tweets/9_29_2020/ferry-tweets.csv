Wants law and order. Has done a good job with COVID and developing a vaccine. Set up manufacturing of vaccine when ready. Peace treaty done!
1310936758209708034,2020-09-29 13:37:33,"@minky2013 @covidcircus1 @petemorristwit I don't think it's like the flu. Why did you assume that? The flu kills 1000s more folk every year, so by that figure alone I'll say that seasonal flu is much worse. 40, 000 died from Covid in England 5'000 in Scotland, mostly sick vulnerable people. Season flu will double that."

1310631590813466624,2020-09-28 17:24:56,@WhitestWizard Agreed! The thing with covid-19 is it is new. There is so much unknown about the virus itself so just because the deaths aren’t as high as before doesn’t mean there aren’t other consequences.
